                <p>I am a hybrid engineer with a BEngTech in Electronics and Computer Engineering. I like solving real world problems and building electronics and embedded projects. I enjoy working with microcontrollers and creating systems that mix hardware and software.</p>

                <p>I build things because I am passionate and creative. I enjoy seeing ideas turn into working solutions. In my spare time, I like doing graphic design and building websites, which helps me think about both function and user experience.</p>

                <p>During my studies, I worked on many projects and led my final year project from idea to a fully working system. I was also a Python tutor at university. Teaching helped me explain technical ideas clearly, be patient, and work well with different people.</p>

                <p>Some of my best moments include taking part in my first hackathon where my team placed second, and participating and winning at the SATNAC 2025 conference in the Western Cape. These experiences helped grow my confidence and interest in building real solutions.</p>
                
                <p>I have also won and placed in several competitions and earned certificates in full stack development and web design. I am now looking for opportunities where I can build useful products, learn new skills, and work with people who enjoy practical and creative problem solving.</p>

                <p>If you would like to work together on creating something beautiful or build your own portfolio website, feel free to reach out to me <strong><a href="#contact">here</a></strong>.</p>
