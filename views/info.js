            <p>I am a hybrid engineer with a BEngTech in Electronics and Computer Engineering. I like solving real world problems and building electronics and embedded projects. I enjoy working with microcontrollers and making systems that mix hardware and software.</p>

            <p>I build things because I am passionate and creative. I like to see my ideas come to life. I also like graphic design and making clear interfaces for users.</p>

            <p>During my studies I did many projects and I led my final year project from idea to working system. I was a Python tutor at university. Teaching helped me explain technical ideas clearly, be patient, and work with different people.</p>

            <p>My best moments include my first hackathon where my team got second place, and participating in the SATNAC 2025 conference in the Western Cape.</p>
            
            <p>I have also won and placed in several competitions, and I hold certificates in full stack development and web design. I am looking for work where I can build useful products, learn new skills, and work with others who like practical solutions.</p>
